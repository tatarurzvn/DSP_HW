A standard stereo analog audio tape recording with the length of 60
minutes and with the frequencies up to 12KHz has to be converted to
digital.

1) What is the maximum sampling frequency? Why?

2) What is the minimum sampling frequency? Why?

3) What level of quantitization (bits per sample) would you choose?

4) What happens if the signal is sampled at 8 Khz?

5) What happens if it is sampled at 96 KHz, with 32 bits per samle. If no
    no encoding/compression is used, how large will be the digital soundtrack?
    What happens if we discard each other second sample?
